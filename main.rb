Reflecting on Principle
1)  How are Ruby modules (and similar features from other langs)
    different from a class, in their purpose?
    --A module is intended to be a more abstract implementation that acts as a template for other things to use
2) What is LSP?
	--Liskov Substitution Principle (sp?) is the idea that a sub class should fit the requirements of
	that of the super class.
3) Briefly describe how the template method pattern works.
	--From what I've gathered, the template method pattern works by creating templates,
	a base method, that can be implemented among multiple classes that need to share a 
	behavior.
